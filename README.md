Obstacle Avoiding Robot is an intelligent device that can automatically sense the obstacle in front of it and avoid them by turning itself in another direction. This design allows the robot to navigate in an unknown environment by avoiding collisions, which is a primary requirement for any autonomous mobile robot. The application of the Obstacle Avoiding robot is not limited and it is used in most of the military organizations now which helps carry out many risky jobs that cannot be done by any soldiers.

We previously built Obstacle Avoiding Robot using Raspberry Pi and using PIC Microcontroller. This time we will build an Obstacle avoiding robot using an ultrasonic sensor and Arduino. Here an Ultrasonic sensor is used to sense the obstacles in the path by calculating the distance between the robot and obstacle. If robot finds any obstacle it changes the direction and continue moving.

How to build obstacle avoiding robot using Ultrasonic Sensor 
Before going to build the robot, it is important to understand how the ultrasonic sensor works because this sensor will have important role in detecting obstacle. The basic principle behind the working of ultrasonic sensor is to note down the time taken by sensor to transmit ultrasonic beams and receiving the ultrasonic beams after hitting the surface. Then further the distance is calculated using the formula. In this project, the widely available HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor is used.
